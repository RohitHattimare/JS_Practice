      <p>
        The recipe is an extremely simple salad yet a healthy one that should be
        a regular dish while serving lunch or dinner along with other meals.
        This can be a part of a balanced diet and can also be tried as a weight
        loss diet recipe.
      </p>
      <p>
        The veggies I am using here are basic and are easily available in every
        vegetable store. I am basically using common veggies such as onions,
        tomatoes, cucumber, cilantro, parsley, carrots and many other veggies
        too can be included.
      </p>
      <p>
        Adding broccoli to the salad makes a healthy option and I have included
        it along with the above-mentioned veggies. To make the salad flavorful,
        adding some tangy touches such as lemon as well as olive oil makes it
        edible and easy to eat.
      </p>

        Check out the detailed ingredients used below to make the recipe that is
        a perfect option for a weight loss salad or weight loss diet. The
        ingredients can be changed as per our preference and many other veggies
        can be altered and replaced with the one's used here.
